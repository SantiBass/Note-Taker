## Description.
### The main purpose of this application is to take notes from the user and save them.  
### The user can type in a title and text for each note. These notes can be saved or deleted. This application has a starter code that deals with the visual part of the application. And, I only had to work on the back end. For example, I created the routes and the server js file.
